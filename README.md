## About
striknina's GTK themes collection. Mostly sweeping recolours of the Arc GTK theme.

(For the time being, until I can make space for a Cinnamon + GNOME install, the themes will not be complete for those two desktops. Sorry.)

## Installation
The themes can be installed by copying the theme folders into `~/.themes`. The easy way would be to clone:
 
```
git clone https://github.com/striknina/gtk-themes ~/.themes
```

To install the themes system-wide (so windows running as root get themed too), copy the theme folders into `/usr/share/themes`.

## Licence
As with the original Arc theme, GPL 3.

## Special thanks
To [the original designer/developer of the Arc theme](https://github.com/horst3180/arc-theme), [the current maintainer](https://github.com/jnsh/arc-theme), and all the contributors throughout the theme's history, for the wonderful work you've done.

To the folks behind [Themix/Oomox](https://github.com/themix-project/oomox), for making many a themer's endeavours easier.

Last but not least, though this may sound weird, to one particular themer: [addy-dclxvi on GitHub](https://github.com/addy-dclxvi/gtk-theme-collections), my gateway to this whole thing.
